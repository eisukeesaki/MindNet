## my mind mapping style

In this file, I will be using mind maps to document my ideas, issues, and tasks for this project.
Which means that I'm using mind maps to build a mind map application... How strange and exciting!

Here's how my mind maps are structured.

```text

my mind maps
    collection
        nodes
            representations of relations
                horizontal arrangement
                    parent node
                        contains child
                        abstracts child
                        owns child
                        consists of child
                    child node
                        is contained within parent
                        specifies parent
                        is owned by parent
                        constitues parent
                vertical arrangement
                    node above
                        more abstract
                    node below
                        more specific
                    not always considred
                        just like in this case

```
